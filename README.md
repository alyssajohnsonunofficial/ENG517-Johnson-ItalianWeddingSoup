## All About Italian Wedding Soup

### What's In It?
* Pasta - usually either Ditalini or Acini de Pepe. I prefer Ditalini!
* Broth - I see chicken broth used pretty often.
* Mini meatballs - sometimes chicken, sometimes beef, sometimes sausage!
* Chopped veggies - carrots, spinach, yellow onion, celery, garlic, etc.
* Optional: Grated parmesan and/or red pepper flakes! I prefer grated parmesan. 

Note: The name has nothing to do with actual weddings. It comes from a mistranslation and actually refers to the "marriage" of meatballs, broth, pasta and veggies, which is seen as a "gendered" combination in Italy.
